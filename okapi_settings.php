    # These settings are for OCPL site, but they should work with most
    # others too.

    # Note, that this file should be located outside of OKAPI directory,
    # directly in your root path.

    # OKAPI needs this file present. Every OC site has to provide it.
    # Since OC sites differ (they don't even have a common-structured
    # settings file), all sites have to provide a valid mapping from
    # *their* settings to OKAPI settings.

    # Note, that this function needs to execute FAST. If your default
    # settings file is not a simple $variable="value" mapping, then you
    # *should* *hardcode* the settings below, instead of including your
    # slow settings file!

    # OKAPI defines only *one* global variable, named 'rootpath'.
    # You may access it to get a proper path to your own settings file.
