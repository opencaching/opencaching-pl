		<p>Submit a log entry for the geocache. Please note, that you won't be
		able to use this method until you learn to handle OAuth.</p>
	</desc>
	<req name='cache_code'>
		<p>Code of the geocache.</p>
	</req>
	<req name='logtype'>
		<p>Type of an entry. This should be one of: <i>Found it</i>, <i>Didn't find it</i>
		or <i>Comment</i>.</p>
	</req>
	<opt name='comment'>
		<p>Text to be submitted with the log entry. Plain-text (no HTML).</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='when'>
		<p>A date and time string, in any reasonable format (any acceptable by
		PHP's <a href='http://pl2.php.net/strtotime'>strtotime</a> function,
		ISO 8601 preffered).</p>
		<p>Indicates when the cache was found. If given, the log will be published
		with the given date and time. If not, log will be published using the current
		date and time.</p>
	</opt>
	<opt name='password'>
		<p>Some caches require a password in order to submit a "Found it" log entry.
		You may check if this cache requires password with <b>req_passwd</b> field
		of the services/caches/geocache method.</p>
	</opt>
	<!--
	This not yet implemented. Remove the comment when/if you implement this.
	<opt name='rating'>
		<p>An integer in range between 1 and 5 - user's optional rating of a found cache.</p>
		<p>Important: <b>logtype</b> has to be "Found it" in order to use the <b>rating</b> argument.
		If you use rating with other type of logtype, you will get a HTTP 400 error (instead of
		a dictionary).</p>
		<p>Note: you should allow your user to <b>not</b> rate a found cache.</p>
