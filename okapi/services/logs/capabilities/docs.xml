    <desc>
        <p>This method tells which features are available for submitting
        or editing a log entry. You may use it to disable nonfunctional
        options in a user interface.</p>

        <p>Using this method is <i>always optional</i>. You never need to
        know about differences between OKAPI installations or logging
        preconditions. If a logging feature is not avaible, OKAPI will
        accept the request and return a user-friendly explanation.</p>
    </desc>
    <req name='reference_item'>
        <p>One of these:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The code of the geocache to be logged. Available features
                for <a href='%OKAPI:methodargref:services/logs/submit%'>services/logs/submit</a>
                will be returned.
            </li>
            <li>
                The UUID of the log entry to be edited. Available features
                for <a href='%OKAPI:methodargref:services/logs/edit%'>services/logs/edit</a>
                will be returned.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The returned values depend on the type and state of the
        geocache, on previous logs and on the OC site. They can change
        any time.</p>
    </req>
    <common-format-params/>
    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary of the following structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>submittable_logtypes</b> - a list of the log types your
                user can currently submit for the geocache (or which can replace
                the type of the log to be edited). Available types depend on
                many conditions, like the cache type and state.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>can_recommend</b> - tells if the user can recommend the
                geocache. One of the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>true</b> if the user can add a recommendation for
                        the geocache,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>need_more_founds</b> if the user needs to
                        find more caches to add a recommendation for the
                        geocache,
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>false</b> if the user cannot recommend the cache
                        for some other reason, e.g. the user owns or already
                        recommended the cache. A submitted recommendation
                        will be ignored.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>rcmd_founds_needed</b>, the number of additional caches
                the user needs to find (or events to attend) to recommend this
                cache; <b>null</b> if <b>can_recommend</b> is <b>false</b>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>can_rate</b> - boolean, <b>true</b> if the user can rate
                the geocache; <b>false</b> if a submitted rating will be ignored.
                Ratings may be disabled for some cache types or for caches
                that the user already rated or owns. Some OC installations do
                not provide ratings at all.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>can_set_needs_maintenance</b> - boolean, <b>true</b>
                if the user can set or confirm a "needs maintenance" status
                of the cache by submitting <i>needs_maintenance2=true</i>;
                <b>false</b> if this argument will be ignored. Logging
                "needs maintenance" may not be available for all cache types.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>can_reset_needs_maintenance</b> - boolean, <b>true</b>
                if the user can reset a "needs maintenance" status of the cache
                (or confirm that ist still is in good shape) by submitting
                <i>needs_maintenance2=false</i>; <b>false</b> if this argument
                will be ignored. This feature is not available yet at some OC
                installations.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>All the <b>can_</b> fields currently are <b>false</b> if a
        log UUID is supplied as <b>reference_item</b>. OKAPI so far does
        not implement editing those log properties.</p>
    </returns>
