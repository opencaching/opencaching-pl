        <p>This method tells which geocache properties are available at this
        OKAPI installation.</p>
        
        <p>Using this method is mostly optional. You never need to know about
        differences between OKAPI installations when searching for or
        retrieving geocaches. But this method may help to improve user
        interfaces, e.g. by hiding unnecessary search options.</p>

                <p><b>types</b> - list of the cache types which are currently
                available at this installation. See the
                <a href='%OKAPI:methodargref:services/caches/geocache%'>services/caches/geocache</a>
                method for more information on cache types.</p>

                <p><b>has_ratings</b> - boolean, <b>true</b> if this installation
                can store geocache quality ratings. OKAPI provides methods to
                submit and retrieve ratings, and to search for geocaches by
                rating.</p>
            </li>

                <p><b>password_max_length</b> - the maximum length of
                a password that will be accepted by
                <a href='%OKAPI:methodargref:services/caches/edit%'>services/caches/edit</a>.</p>
