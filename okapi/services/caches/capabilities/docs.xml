    <brief>Get information on available geocache properties</brief>

    <desc>
        <p>Returns information on available geocache properties at this
        OKAPI installation.</p>
        
        <p>You may need this method when
        <a href='%OKAPI:methodargref:services/caches/edit%'>editing</a> geocache
        listings and when searching for caches by type. In all other
        cases, you don't need to know about differences between OKAPI
        installations. But still this method may help to improve usability
        of your app, e.g. by hiding unnecessary search options.</p>
    </desc>
    <opt name='fields' default='types|sizes|statuses|has_ratings'>
        <p>Pipe-separated list of field names which you are interested in.
        Selected fields will be included in the response. See below for the
        list of available fields.</p>
        <p>(Why a fields option? Because fields like <i>countries</i> and
        <i>languages</i> may be added, that return lots of data or are
        expensive to calculate.)</p>
    </opt>
    <common-format-params/>
    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary of the fields you have selected. Currently available fields:</p>

                method to find out if a given geocache can be rated.</p>
